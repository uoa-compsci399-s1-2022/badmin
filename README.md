Spellz, a proofreading and spelling game.

Here is a screenshot of the group Jira Roadmap: ![Jira Roadmap](https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s1-2022/badmin/blob/main/Images/Jira%20Roadmap%20ReadME.png)

Description:
Team Badmin created Spellz to improve upon the ReType tool developed by our clients. Spellz is an engaging proofreading game, which implements the full ReType functionality in the form of a vanilla Javascript web application. This means that Spellz will include existing ReType mechanics such as scores, combos and hints, while also "gamifiying" the entire process.

Technologies:
The project was completed using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. Libraries such as Diff-Match-Patch and Chart.js were also used. We used Jira as our project management tool and used FireBase to deploy our website. All members used VSCode as their main IDE and used extensions such as LiveShare to allow for peer-programming.

Setup:
There are no prerequitistes for our project. In order to play Spellz, simply go to https://spellz2022.web.app/ ! 

Usage:
Spellz has a simple user interface and provides first time users with a tutorial which explains basic game mechanics. Below are some screenshots that demostrate sample gameplay.

Future Plans:
Potential ideas for future releases is to incorporate a leader board, have additional themes, a badge system and more animations. These will help to increase user engagement with our game!

Acknowledgements:
Team Badmin would like to acknowledge our lecturer, tutors and clients for the efforts, resources and time spent to help improve Spellz.
