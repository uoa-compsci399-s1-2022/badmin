The project aim is to promote spelling and making it engaging for users by being versatile whilst being simple. It is also noted ReType functionality is one of most effective methods, so our game incorporates that functionality. Our game also has many other game elements to further raise its appeal. 

Programming languages used to build this website was vanilla JavaScript(JS), CSS and HTML. We also imported Chart.js library and Diff-Match-Patch for JS library in order to create our project.

The source code editor of choice was Visual Studio Code.

In order to install and setup the project, you are required to have a stable internet connection and as it is an HTML page, a web browser to run this page on.

Potential ideas for future releases is to incorporate a leader board, have additional themes, a badge system and more animations.

We would like to acknowledge our lecturer, tutor and clients for being really accommodating and helping us along the way.
